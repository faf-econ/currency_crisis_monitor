The [currency monitor](https://faf-econ.shinyapps.io/currency_crisis_monitor/) is a Shiny app which allows the user to track currency pressure in different countries. There are two main options:

1. **World Map** shows the evolution of currency crisis from 1974. More intense colors indicate more crisis occurrences.

2. **Individual Countries** shows the evolution of:
  - Exchange Rate Pressure Index, the trigger, and identifies the months when a currency crisis occurred.
  - Exchange Rate
  - International Reserves
